# Hello, Hi and Welcome
Welcome to my little personal project!

If you can see this, great! seems I was not a wuss and pushed this to a public repo... but because I have no background in coding / programming I will most likely chicken out and keep this in a private repo.

So, what is this "discord bot" about?  
Actually, I don't know. I am currently studying IT Security and for this it seems we need to learn a little bit of programming (to parse log files and such stuff).

Because python was the recommended language, I though to make a little project while learning python / coding in general.  
Fascinating new world for me coming from Sys Admin Field and I honestly feel too stupid to learn how to code, but I'll try anyway.

Alright, I believe that should be enough for a little readme about this.  
Thanks for reading and have a great day!

Ps. What i forgot: Not only programming is new for me but also everything that has to do with it. So best not look at my commits as git is as new for me as programming and I have absolutely no idea what I'm, doing.
